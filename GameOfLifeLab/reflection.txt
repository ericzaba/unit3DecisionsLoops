What did you like or dislike?
I definitely liked challenging myself with an algorithm that seemed simple at first, but grew in complexity as it had to be converted into code.
Why?
I thought it was both frustrating and a break from the normal tedious programming tasks.

What was suprising or unexpected?
It was both suprising and unexpected that I had to recreate the grid every time a new generation was stepped into existence, because I thought
there would be a more efficient way,  maybe manipulating the current grid, to do the lab.
I was also suprised by how long it took.
What did you learn?
I learned mostly about how important getting the value of an int or a float is, and how it is  very bad idea to try and make local variables in the method that is manipulating the variables
What questions do you still have?
Why does a new grid have to always be created? why is there not a set of methods to manipulate the current gridWorld? what in java prevents this from being the case?
What advice would you offer next year's students?
Do the assignment before its due, so you don't have to scramble to finish it last minute.
